what is head?

It's the entry point — the only node you directly keep track of.
From the head, you can reach every other node by following .next


does head have to be the at the beginning of the ll always?

yes.

A linked list is not like an array.
In an array, you can access any element by index.
In a linked list, you can only get to elements by starting from the first node and following .next links.
you should create a temporary pointer, not move the head.

so when when you are using traversing you are using the temporary pointer
