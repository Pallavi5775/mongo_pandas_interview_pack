7-Day Linked List Mastery Roadmap

(Hands-on + Mental Visualization Plan)

Each day adds one layer of conceptual depth + one type of pointer movement pattern.
If you follow this structure, you’ll not only solve problems — you’ll see what’s happening in memory.

🟢 Day 1: Foundations — Node & Structure

Goal: Understand Node creation, linking, and traversal.

Concepts:

Node structure (data, next)
Build, traverse, insert, delete
Visualizing head → next → next
Why pointers are references to memory

Exercises:

Create a linked list manually (3–5 nodes)

Write functions: insert_begin, insert_end, delete_value

Trace by printing addresses (id(node) in Python)

Visualization:

head → [10|•] → [20|•] → [30|None]


Pointer Motion Idea:
Each .next is a pointer (arrow).
Moving a pointer = moving the "arrow" to the next node.

🟡 Day 2: Traversal and Two Pointers

Goal: Master pointer movement logic.

Concepts:

Single pointer traversal

Two-pointer methods (slow-fast)

Finding middle

Detecting cycle

Exercises:

Find middle node

Detect a loop (Floyd’s cycle detection)

Remove a loop

Visualization (Cycle Detection):

fast = head.next.next
slow = head.next
While fast != slow:
    fast → jumps 2 nodes
    slow → jumps 1 node


ASCII Simulation:

slow:  A → B → C → D
fast:  A → C → E → (wraps) → B
Eventually meet at same node

🔵 Day 3: Reversal and Recursive Thinking

Goal: Understand pointer flipping.

Concepts:

Iterative reversal (prev, curr, next)

Recursive reversal

Palindrome (stack-based + half-reversal)

Exercise:

Reverse list iteratively and recursively

Check palindrome

Visualization:
Before:

head → A → B → C → None


Iteration:

Step1: A.next=None, prev=A, curr=B
Step2: B.next=A, prev=B, curr=C
Step3: C.next=B, prev=C, curr=None


Final:

C → B → A → None


Draw it on paper with arrows.
Each “flip” is a reversed pointer direction.

🟠 Day 4: Divide & Conquer — Merge Sort + Merge Lists

Goal: Visualize recursive split and merge operations.

Concepts:

Midpoint finding

Merge two sorted lists

Merge sort on linked lists

Exercise:

Write merge_sorted() (two-pointer)

Implement merge_sort()

Visualization:

Split:
1 → 3 → 5 → 2 → 4
      ↓
   mid pointer
Left: 1 → 3 → 5
Right: 2 → 4
Merge process:
Compare heads, attach smaller, move pointer


ASCII merge:

dummy → 1
dummy → 1 → 2
dummy → 1 → 2 → 3
dummy → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

🔴 Day 5: Pointer Rewiring Patterns

Goal: Deepen intuition for pointer redirection and node skipping.

Concepts:

K-group reversal

Rotate by K

Remove Nth from end

Exercise:

Implement and trace reverse_k_group()

Draw node connections per step

Visualization (Rotate by K=2):

1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Tail connects to head → 5 → 1
Break before new_head (3):
New: 4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3

🟣 Day 6: Multi-level and Doubly Linked Lists

Goal: Think in 2D and bidirectional pointers.

Concepts:

Doubly linked list (prev + next)

Flatten multi-level list

Stack-based pointer management

Exercise:

Implement flatten with child pointers

Draw flattened list

Visualization:

1 → 2 → 3
     ↓
     4 → 5
Flatten:
1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 3


ASCII tracking:

push(next=3)
curr=2 → next=child=4
child=flattened
if curr.next=None and stack not empty → pop and connect
